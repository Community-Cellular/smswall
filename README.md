# smswall: lists over sms #

smswall lets you send text messages to a group. Think of it like a mailing list
server, but for SMS. It's designed for use at Burning Man as part of the Papa
Legba cell phone network.

To run smswall, you're going to need and installation of yate, OpenBTS, and
associated hardware. You can test it without any of that though.
